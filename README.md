Florida school teachers are required to develop and provide coursework that adheres to educational standards created by the Florida Department of Education. This deters teachers from creating curriculums based on engineering because it is not easy to immediately spot the standards that these topics would fall under. To help teachers create design engineering-based curriculums while staying in line with the standards, we created issle.
Issle (which stands for “integrating standards for students learning engineering”) is planned to provide a simple interface for teachers to create lesson plans while letting them link standards to them as they work. Users will be given hints and examples for all fields inside of a lesson plan framework to ensure that they are able to easily create their projects. Additionally, users will be able to share lesson plans linked to their account as well as view other posted lesson plans.

## People/organizations involved in the creation of issle
* Bootstrap
  * Used Navbar design, glyphicon, headers, section headers
* CPALMS database
  * Collect and store standards into database on Mongodb
  
## Features

#### Engineering Design Frame page

This page allows teachers to create their own engineering design projects, add multiple subjects to their projects, and link standards. These projects can be saved as drafts, and the user also has the option to mark a project as private (in which they will be the only user allowed to access the project).

#### User Accounts

issle also supports unique user accounts where each user can create, modify, and delete their own projects. Other settings associated with user accounts include changing user settings, such as school, username, email, and password, as well as changing a profile picture. Through the **My Projects** header in the user account page, users can also print out their projects to list them in their physical lesson plans.

#### Search Standards

A search standards system was also created, where teachers can look up Florida educational standards based on a grade and subject or by a keyword. The search will retrieve Florida common core standards to be referenced by the engineering design projects created by the user.

#### Search Projects

The search projects page provides a way for teachers to look up public projects that meet a certain standard, name, or keyword.

#### User Support

User support in issle consists of an example page with framework designed for helping teachers understand the process of generating their own project ideas. An FAQ also exists to address common website navigation questions, educational standards, and user settings, referenced in the sidebar of the design engineering frame.
